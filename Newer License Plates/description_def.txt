V 1.2.1
Check out the forum for full changelog!
Place at a high priority in mod manager.
Works with any map mod! All 48 mainland states, some Mexican states and 2 provinces now have updated license plate textures and text formats from the year 2025.
 
NO MAP MODS REQUIRED FOR THIS MOD TO WORK.

I created this mod for American Truck Simulator because seeing outdated 1990s-2000s license plates in-game was really bothering me. It's 2025—most people don't drive around with those anymore!

After weeks of learning how to mod and developing this project, I’m proud to share the final product.

I'll be reading every comment on the download sites, so if you have complaints, questions, or suggestions, bring them on!

I'm also planning future updates, including removing front license plates for states that don’t require them.

Thanks for checking it out, and happy trucking!

Some examples:
CALIFORNIA: Added "DMV.CA.GOV" on the bottom and added stickers
PENNSYLVANIA: Added keystone logo
NEW YORK: Replaced the orange license plate (2011-2020) to the "Excelsior" license plate (2021-present)
MONTANA: Replaced old license plate with the blue license plate (2010-present)
ILLINOIS: Replaced old license plate (2004-2016) to the new one (2017-present)

These kind of changes were made to most states, have fun!
